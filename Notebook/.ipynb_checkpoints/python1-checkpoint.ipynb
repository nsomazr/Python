    "####  What is Python?\n",
    " - High-level,\n",
    " - General purpose,\n",
    " - Interpreted,\n",
    "  Interactive and object-oriented scripting language.\n",
    "Python is designed to be highly readable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features of Python\n",
    "- Easy to learn\n",
    "- Easy to read \n",
    "- Easy to maintain\n",
    "- A broad standard libraries\n",
    "- Interactive mode\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "**\"Why Python?“**\n",
    " The answer is simple: it is powerful yet very\n",
    "accessible.\n",
    " Also Python has become the most popular programming language for data science because it allows us to forget about the tedious parts of programming and offers us an environment where we can quickly jot down our ideas and put concepts directly into action.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Python Installation\n",
    "\n",
    " - To install Python open a web browser go to this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads).\n",
    "   Run the downloaded file.\n",
    " - Just accept the default settings and wait until the install is finished.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Python IDLE\n",
    "\n",
    "- IDLE is a simple integrated development environment (IDE) that comes with Python.\n",
    "  It’s a program that allows us to type in our programs and run them.\n",
    "  You can find IDLE in the Python 3.7 folder on your computer. \n",
    " \n",
    "- When is started , the IDLE starts up in the shell, which is an interactive window where we can type   in Python code and see the output in the same window. \n",
    "- Most of the time we will want to open up a new window and type the program in there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- We can use another Python platform called Anaconda. \n",
    "- It includes different of popular data science packages and virtual environment manager.\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook Is an open source web application interactive and exploratory computing.\n",
    "- It allows us to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. \n",
    "- We will work in Jupyter notebooks for all practices\n",
